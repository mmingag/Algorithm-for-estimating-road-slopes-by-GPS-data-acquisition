# Algorithm-for-estimating-road-slopes-by-GPS-data-acquisition
The project provides knowledge on estimating the slope of the road by processing signals captured by the Data Logger OBD-GPS Freematics ONE+ using a differential filter, for the calculation of the slope of the road and the use of the orthometric height on the back of the ellipsoidal heights obtained by the GPS.
